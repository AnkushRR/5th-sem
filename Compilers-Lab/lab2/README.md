# Lexical Parser in Lex  

Very simple program in Lex for parsing a file with code and create a token stream and a symbol table.  
Make sure that you have a text file with code in it.
for this, we are using [lex_parser_input.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-xync/5th-sem/master/Compilers-Lab/lab2/lex_parser_input.txt).  
To execute, use  
`lex lex_parser.l`  
`gcc lex.yy.c -lfl`  
`./a.out`  
The output looks like this
